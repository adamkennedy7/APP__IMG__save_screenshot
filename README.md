# APP__save-screenshot.py

## Overview

This Python script, named `APP__save-screenshot.py`, is a console application that captures a screenshot of the current display and provides various analysis and logging functionalities.

## Context

The script runs within the context of creating an enterprise application, as described by the user profile. It builds on the functionality of the `FCN__time__t62` module, naming its class instance `T62`. The script takes captures of the screen for further analysis.

## Imports and Constants

The script starts by importing needed modules such as `os`, `time`, `configparser`, `ImageGrab`, `ImageStat`, `logging`, `platform`, and `psutil`. Imported modules are used to facilitate various tasks within the script. Several constants and paths are also defined for configuration and path management.

## Functions

The script includes several functions for various tasks:

### `stopwatch()`

This function begins the stopwatch for performance tracking. It returns the elapsed time since the stopwatch was set.

### `load_config_ini()`

This function loads application configurations from `__config.ini` using the `configparser` module.

### `configure_logging()`

This function configures the logging system to print to the terminal and save to a text file. It is called to set up the logging system.

### `log(level, message, emoji="")`

This function handles logging to both the terminal and log file. It has special handling for various types of data such as ints, lists, and dictionaries. When handling dictionaries, it uses the `PrettyTable` module to draw tables with left-aligned text.

### `get_screenshot()`

This function captures a screenshot using `ImageGrab.grab()`. It returns the captured image or `False` in case of an error.

### `save_screenshot(image)`

This function saves the captured image to a path defined by `IMG_PATH`.

### `analyze_image(image, file_path)`

This function performs analysis on the captured image. It returns various findings such as resolution, file size, mean color, and extrema.

## Script Execution

The script begins with the loading of configurations from `__config.ini`. It then sets up the logging system and captures a screenshot using `get_screenshot()`. The captured image is then saved using `save_screenshot()`. Analysis of the image is conducted using `analyze_image()`, which provides various findings such as resolution, file size, and color information.

## Terminal Output

The terminal output provides information about the script's progress, including messages, logs, and tables. The logging system is used to record these messages and findings to a text file.

## Conclusion

This script, `APP__save-screenshot.py`, is a comprehensive application for capturing screenshots, analyzing them, and logging various findings. It uses multiple functions to facilitate these tasks and provides detailed output to the terminal and log file.
